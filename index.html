          <p>Since 1982, Apple Harvest Festival hosts plenty of apples, local produce, fresh baked goods, family entertainment at every turn, games, rides, prizes and live performances on two stages. Over 100 talented artists, crafters, bakers, and makers come together for the Apple Harvest Craft Fair! Find creative, unique works from clothing to woodworking, ceramics to paintings, fudge to essential oils and beyond throughout the festival.

          Downtown Ithaca will welcome a couple farmers to sell their harvest bounty throughout the week in a socially distant, de-densified version of a farmers market and cider trail happening on the Commons and inside downtown shops and restaurants in the district.

          Shops and restaurants who have safely reopened may feature apple & cider themed menus and gifts for sale too. The collection outlined on a Cider Trail.

          As part of the Cider Trail experience, participants can share Instagram and Facebook photos throughout the week and enter to win a Downtown Ithaca Gift card when they hashtag their photos with #FeelingAppleFestive & #DowntownIthaca <!-- Source:https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-festive/"-->
