            <em>Be Safe & Socially Distant & Responsible!</em>
            During the day, a couple of farms will have pop-up farm stands each afternoon on the commons to sell pre-packed Apples, Cider and other fall produce for contactless grab & go.

            Lines with 6' or more of social distance between customers will be in place at the farm stands and all customers and farmers are required to wear masks.

            Hand sanitizer is stationed around the Ithaca Commons, and patrons are encouraged to bring their own for personal use as well.<!-- Source:https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-festive/"-->

        <h2>Cider Week  Finger Lakes</h2>
        </div>
        <p><em>Finger Lakes Cider Week is also returning to the region October 2 - 11, 2020.</em>
        <br>
        As Apple Festive winds down, Cider Week will ramp up with virtual tasting events online as well as Orchard tours and ticketed, socially distant food & cider pairing dinners. Now in its 10th YEAR, New York Cider Weeks have become known for bringing people together and creating connections to celebrate and promote New York cider. This year, in an effort to keep everyone safe while still celebrating some of the best cider in the world, weâ€™re continuing the tradition in a very unique way. Cider Weeks across the state will now include a variety of virtual events! This year, in addition to attending some socially distanced in-person events, you can join the cider conversations, visit cider orchards and learn about our cider producers all virtually.

        Now more than ever, we strongly believe in the mission of NY Cider Weeks to bring people together and make connections over cider. Imagine a cider week with online programming that includes tastings, happy hour cocktail recipes, orchard & cidery tours, panel conversations, chef and cider pairings all broadcast via YouTube on the the New York Cider Association TV channel.

        Registration to attend the virtual events is free and you can register on our events page. Both virtual and in-person events are posted daily so be sure to check the Cider Week page or follow us on Instagram @newyorkcider for updates.

        Participation in NY Cider Weeks is completely free! However, donations will help us continue to cultivate the New York Cider industry in a meaningful way. 20% of proceeds donated will be given to the Restaurant Workers Community Foundation focused on Covid-19 relief and issues of Social Justice. <!-- Source:https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-festive/"-->
