        A convenient shuttle route (the #10 line) takes passengers to and from Cornell University every ten minutes between 7:30am and 8:00pm Monday – Friday. The shuttle departs from the Seneca St. station, located at the corner of Seneca and N. Tioga.</p>
        <h4>Know how to bike?</h4>
        <p>Recently introduced to Tompkins County, Lime Bikes are a new bike share service that allows you to pick up a bike anytime anywhere downtown and leave it anywhere when you’re done.  So simple and convenient.

        A simple enough service to use.  Download the Lime Bike app on your smartphone device to unlock the nearest bike to get moving.  Lime Bike charges approx. $1/30 minutes, $2/hour.
